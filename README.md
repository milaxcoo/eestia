# **Eestia: A Constructed Language Project**

**Eestia is a minimalist, hybrid constructed language built on a principle of "core duality." This repository contains the complete formal reference, a foundational lexicon, and an interactive web application for exploring its unique grammar.**  
This project showcases system design, information architecture, and the ability to synthesize creative linguistic rules into a technical product.

### **Core Philosophy: The Duality**

Eestia is not one language, but two systems under one roof:

* **Informal (SVO):** A direct, efficient SVO grammar for everyday use.  
* **Formal (SOV):** A nuanced, literary SOV grammar using particles, inspired by Japanese.

* ðŸš€ [**Interactive Sentence Builder (Live Demo\!)**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://YourUsername.github.io/eestia-language-project/sentence-builder/)**:** Build sentences and see the dual grammar in action\! *(Note: Replace the link with your live GitHub Pages URL after deployment).*

### **Technical Details**

The interactive sentence builder is a single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, styled with Tailwind CSS. It is designed to be a lightweight, responsive learning tool.
