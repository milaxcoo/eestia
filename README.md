Eestia: A Constructed Language Project

Eestia is a minimalist, hybrid constructed language built on a principle of "core duality." This repository contains the complete formal reference, a foundational lexicon, and an interactive web application for exploring its unique grammar.

This project showcases system design, information architecture, and the ability to synthesize creative linguistic rules into a technical product.
Core Philosophy: The Duality

Eestia is not one language, but two systems under one roof:

    Informal (SVO): A direct, efficient SVO grammar for everyday use.

    Formal (SOV): A nuanced, literary SOV grammar using particles, inspired by Japanese.
